Last night, I went to The Museum here in Kitchener to enjoy a Beer & Brushes night with SocialArt KW. This is what I painted. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b3240cba-4a16-4a32-96ea-758cc12548fb.jpg)

This is my favourite little corner. It looks like a hidden gully that I could easily hike into, maybe set up camp in. 

The social painting experience is a bit weird for me. There were at least 50 people there, all following the step by step instructions. Most were there with friends or a partner, and I was there all by myself. I felt a little bit out of place - a little bit sorry for myself - but also kind of liberated and strong - like 'that's right! I can brave social time all by myself!'. 

I will say this, though - making the switch from the luscious, heavily pigmented Golden fluid acrylic to whatever this paint was - opaque, a bit muddy - was a little bit painful. 

Still. I learned a lot, and I'm sure I'll do it again. I might bring a friend next time, though, just so I don't feel a little bit like I'm lost in a forest of strangers. :)
